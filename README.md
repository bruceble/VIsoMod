# VIsoMod
Vocal Isolation Model Builder

This Project reads in .wav files of Vocal and Non - Vocal nature and produces a train and verif data set in order to use for a machine learning, vocal isolation task (part of the Mu.S.I.C.A. project).

A binary tree data structure with linked lists is used to organize each vocal audio and its corresponding mixes with non vocal audio.

This uses files from the Mu.S.I.C.A project (AudioView.cpp and AudioView.hpp) to calculate the short - time fourier transforms and produce spectrograph data.
